## A Sample Web Scraper

### What is all this about?

This is an example code snippet of a web scraper written in Python using the lxml library. It gets a webpage using the requests module, parses it using the lxml library, then dumps the data into a CSV file using the csv module. It can be much improved upon.

This exploration of data analysis was sparked by http://schoolofdata.org/ and I'm thinking up ways of how awesome this is going to be when used with Django.
