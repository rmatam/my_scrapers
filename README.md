## A Sample Web Scraper

### What is all this about?

These are web scraping code snippets which use the excellent lxml and Requests libraries. Some of them are cool, some of them are a simple introduction, but they all give data.

This exploration of data analysis was sparked by http://schoolofdata.org/ and I'm thinking up ways of how awesome this is going to be when used with Django.
